# BillingProcess

-In this solution I have 5 projects : DataAccess , Frontend , Models , Utility , BillingProcess(Backend API)
-I have used three models student , bill and Payment and created their API which is performing CRUD.
-In the frontend project I have used these APIs as Consuming APIs and performed CRUD operations.
-I have used a Local User which is generating JWT token in the backend and we can authroize the API using that.
